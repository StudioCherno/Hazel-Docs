# Supported Platforms
Here you can find a list of the platforms that Hazel currently supports.

If you can't find the platform you're looking for on this page you should assume that Hazel does not currently, and most likely never will, support that platform.

## Fully Supported
These are the platforms that Hazel has been tested on, and we've determined that Hazel should run without any serious problems.

If you find an issue relating to any of these platforms please open an issue here: [https://gitlab.com/chernoprojects/Hazel-dev/-/issues]()

* Windows 10 (64-bit)
* Windows 11 (64-bit)

**NOTE:** Hazel currently only considers 64-bit Windows versions supported, and it's unlikely that 32-bit support will ever be added

## Unsupported Platforms
These are platforms that Hazel most likely won't work on.

* Windows 7
* MacOS
* Linux Based Platforms (Will eventually be supported)

# Supported Editors + Toolchains
Hazel will in theory support any IDE or toolchain that [https://premake.github.io/docs/Using-Premake#using-premake-to-generate-project-files](premake) supports, however we've only tested the toolchains/IDEs listed below.

* Visual Studio 2022
* Visual Studio 2019
* CodeLite
