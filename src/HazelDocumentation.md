# Hazel Documentation

Hazel is a real-time interactive application and rendering engine created by _Studio Cherno_ and community volunteers. Check out the [main website](https://hazelengine.com) for more information about Hazel.

This site will continue to grow and house the documentation for using Hazel. Check out the [Getting Started](GettingStarted.md) page for information on how to build and run Hazel.
