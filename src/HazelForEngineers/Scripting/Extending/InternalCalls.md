# Adding Internal Calls (Interop with C# and C++)
You should only add an internal call if you want C# code to call some function in C++, you might want this if you want the added performance of C++, or because you need to interface with, or expose a C++ API to C#.

I'll start by providing guidelines for adding internal calls, *please* make sure that you follow these guidelines, they're here to make it far easier for others to understand and maintain code that you write, and for the sake of consistency.

## Guidelines for writing internal calls in C#
When you add the internal calls to the C# API here are some things you need to consider:
1. Internal methods should **always** be defined inside the `InternalCalls.cs` file. Never in the classes that use these methods.
2. Internal methods should **always** be defined inside of a `#region` block to keep the file organized. You can take a look at how other regions are written.
3. Internal methods should **always** be named in this format: `ClassName_FunctionName`, e.g `TransformComponent_GetTranslation`, or `MeshComponent_GetMaterial`.
4. Internal methods should **always** be defined as `internal static extern`
5. Internal methods should **always** have the same name in C++ as in C#, so a method called `TransformComponent_GetTranslation` should also be called that in C++.
6. Internal methods **must** be marked with this attribute: `[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.InternalCall)]`
7. If you need to pass primitive types (numerical types, `bool`, `char` or `object`) to an internal call they should be copied, or passed as `out`, not passed as `ref`.
8. If you need an internal method to return a primitive type, it should either have that type as the return type, or it should be passed as an `out` parameter.
	E.g `internal static extern bool`, or `internal static extern void SomeClass_SomeFunc(out bool result)`, use `out` if you need to return multiple parameters.
9. If you need to pass a `struct` to the internal call you **have** to pass it as either `ref` or `out` depending on if the C++ function will read from, or write to the struct
10. Passing a struct as `ref` means that the C++ function will only read from the struct, never write to it. It's *your* responsibility to follow this rule, Mono won't enforce it.
11. Passing a struct as `out` means that the C++ function will read from or write to the struct
12. Passing a struct as `out` or `ref` means that the C++ function will take in an equivalent C++ struct as a pointer
13. Enums should NOT be passed as `ref` or `out`! They're just primitive types, they can be passed as is if there's a C++ equivalent enum, or they can be passed as int.

These are some of the basic things you need to keep in mind, feel free to let me know if you think these guidelines should be updated!

## Guidelines for writing internal calls in C++
When you add the internal calls to the C++ API these are some things you need to keep in mind:
1. The C++ implementation of an internal call should **always** be declared in the `ScriptGlue.h` file, and defined in `ScripGlue.cpp`.
2. In order to register the internal call with the C++ API you have to add this line: `HZ_ADD_INTERNAL_CALL(ClassName_FunctionName);` to `ScriptGlue::RegisterInternalCalls`, preferably in the same order that it's declared in `InternalCalls.cs`.
3. If an internal method as to log a message it should preferably log these messages to the Hazelnut console, e.g using `HZ_CONSOLE_LOG_INFO`. This isn't required though and mainly depends on what you're logging.
4. Always add internal calls *inside* the `InternalCalls` namespace in C++. This is **required** in order to register the function

There's understandably a lot more to keep in mind, but the key point is to follow these guidelines, and to make sure the code you add is consistent with the code that's already in the C++ and C# API.

## Example
Here's a very basic example of how to add an internal call to the scripting API, we'll start with declaring the internal call in C#:

Imagine we have a custom struct in C#, and we want to populate that struct with some data from C++, and have our internal call return `true` if it succeeds. Here's what struct might look like:
```cs
// You have to add this attribute to structs that you want to pass to C++
[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]
public struct MyCustomData
{
	public float MyFloat;
	public int SomeInt;
}
```

```cs
// InternalCalls.cs

...

#region MyCustomComponent

[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.InternalCall)]
internal static extern bool MyCustomComponent_GetCustomStruct(ulong entityID, out MyCustomData outData);

#endregion

...

```

Here you can see we define the internal call, it returns a `bool`, and takes in two parameters, the `entityIDÂ´ parameter is just for consistency here, all C# components have to pass the entity's ID to C++ so the engine can know what entity the component belongs to.

And it also takes our custom struct as an `out` parameter, this means that we expect C++ to write some data into this struct, but it can also read from it.

That's really all you need to do in order to define the method in C#. Then in C++ we'll add this code:
```cpp
// MyCustomData struct (can be a class in C++ but use struct where possible)
struct MyCustomData
{
	float MyFloat;
	int SomeInt;
};

// ScriptGlue.h

namespace InternalCalls {

...

#pragma region MyCustomComponent

bool MyCustomComponent_GetCustomStruct(uint64_t entityID, MyCustomData* outData);

#pragma endregion

...
}
```
and then in `ScriptGlue.cpp` we add the implementation of this function:
```cpp
// ScriptGlue.cpp

namespace InternalCalls {

...

#pragma region MyCustomComponent

bool MyCustomComponent_GetCustomStruct(uint64_t entityID, MyCustomData* outData)
{
	// NOTE: Dummy code, look at the existing internal calls for reference
	if (!is_entity_valid)
	{
		// Log some error here
		return false;
	}

	if (!entity_has_MyCustomComponent)
	{
		// Should almost never happen but log error if it does
		return false;
	}

	*outData = myCustomComponent.MyData;
	// OR:
	*outData.MyFloat = someFloatValue;
	*outData.SomeInt = someIntValue;
	return true;
}

#pragma endregion

...
}
```

This just covers the basics of adding internal calls, but it should give you an idea as to how it's done.
